<div>
	<p>
		Determines the action when a Code Dx error occurs, such as connection issues or analysis failure (if "Wait for
		Analysis Results" is enabled).
	</p>
	<p>
		If set to "Ignore Errors", the build will always succeed when an error occurs, regardless
		of any unstable/failure conditions set in the "Wait for Analysis Results" section.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Does not affect behavior for internal plugin errors, eg configuration errors or unexpected exceptions - these
		will still cause build errors.)
