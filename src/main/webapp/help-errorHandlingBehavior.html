<div>
	<p>
		Determines the action when a connection error occurs, or when the analysis fails. If
		set to "Ignore Errors", the build will always succeed when an error occurs, regardless
		of any "Build Failure Conditions" or "Build Unstable Conditions" set in the
		"Wait for Analysis Results" section.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Does not affect behavior for internal plugin errors, eg configuration errors or unexpected exceptions - these
		will still cause build errors.)
