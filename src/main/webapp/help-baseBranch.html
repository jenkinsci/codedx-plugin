		The Code Dx branch to use as the parent if the specified "target branch" does not exist yet.
		The new branch will inherit the findings of the base branch. The branch must exist in the
		Code Dx project beforehand.

		set to "Project Name", the specified project does not exist, and auto-create is enabled in that section.
