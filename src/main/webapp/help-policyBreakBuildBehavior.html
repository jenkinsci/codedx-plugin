	<p>
		Determines the build result if at least one of the Code Dx project's violated policies has
		its action set to "Break build".
	</p>
	<p>
		A policy is only violated if one of its rules is matched and the finding age exceeds the "fix by"
		field of the policy rule. If a new finding is introduced which violates a policy rule, but that
		rule has its "fix by" set to anything other than "Not required", the build will not be
		affected until a finding meets the required age.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Note: policies are supported in Code Dx 2023.1.0 and up. This option will be ignored if using an older Code Dx version.)
